# Audio classification with machine learning
This repository of the work I have done during my research paper
this repository will show all the work done during the research paper. the audio datasets used in this research paper are Chinese and Pakistani audio tracks; each audio track is about 10 sec. multiple classifiers and statistical models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are employed to evaluate the performance of the selected features. The process involves feeding the extracted features into the machine learning algorithms, training the classification models with test data, and using the confusion matrix and model accuracy to evaluate the models.

Steps are as follows:
# Step 1:
preprocessing and finding the audio features 
# step 2
feeding the audio features in CSV into to above-mentioned algorithms 
# step 3
analyzing the data with the help of Python libraries 

# plotting the Data 

# CNN
